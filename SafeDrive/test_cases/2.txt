Scenario:
You are driving on a highway road with 2 lanes, and you are currently driving in the right lane. Navigation indicates you should change to the left lane. 
Your current position is (269.28, 10.85), speed is (-24.40, -0.08) m/s, acceleration is (0.06, -0.03) m/s^2.
There are other vehicles driving around you, and below is their basic information:
-Vehicle `993.0` is driving in front in the right lane. Position: (207.79, 10.47), Speed: (-24.49, 0.02) m/s, Acceleration: (0.00, -0.07) m/s^2, quantified perceived risk: 855.87.
-Vehicle `994.0` is driving in front in the right lane. Position: (244.39, 9.53), Speed: (-24.73, 0.05) m/s, Acceleration: (-0.05, 0.03) m/s^2, quantified perceived risk: 11140.47. 
-Vehicle `999.0` is driving behind in the left lane. Position: (292.34, 14.12), Speed: (-44.26, 0.09) m/s, Acceleration: (-0.63, -0.08) m/s^2, quantified perceived risk: 43897.07. 
-Vehicle `1000.0` is driving behind in the left lane. Position: (330.28, 14.74), Speed: (-42.10, 0.04) m/s, Acceleration: (-0.53, -0.04) m/s^2, quantified perceived risk: 14038.56. 

Vehicles 993, 994 exhibit minimal risk levels, requiring no immediate intervention.
Vehicles 1000 exhibit risk slightly above typical levels. Maintain increased awareness of these vehicles during decision making.
Vehicles 999 exhibit exceptional risk. Exercise rigorous caution with these vehicles, and avoid taking actions involving them until the risk is sufficiently mitigated.
Risk Quantification Structure: 
According to the structure of the risk field formulation, if the quantified perceived risk from a surrounding vehicle is high, there are several potential reasons. Keep the followings in mind when the QPR is elevated:
- The distance between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicle is short. Vehicles might be too close to each other.
- The speed of either the ego vehicle or the surrounding vehicle is high, which usually happens when one vehicle is overtaking the other.
- The heading angle of the ego vehicle or the surrounding vehicle is towards the other, which usually happens during lane changes or cutting in.
