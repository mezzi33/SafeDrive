Scenario:
You are driving on a highway road with 2 lanes, and you are currently driving in the right lane. Navigation indicates you should change to the left lane.
Your current position is (353.28, 10.07), speed is (-30.89, 0.10) m/s, acceleration is (0.09, 0.04) m/s^2.
There are other vehicles driving around you, and below is their basic information:
-Vehicle `468.0` is driving in front in the right lane. Position: (306.90, 10.95), Speed: (-43.81, -0.31) m/s, Acceleration: (-0.40, 0.32) m/s^2, quantified perceived risk: 7162.87.

-Vehicle `471.0` is driving in front in the left lane. Position: (365.26, 14.51), Speed: (-39.94, 0.03) m/s, Acceleration: (-0.01, -0.02) m/s^2, quantified perceived risk: 34855.00.

-Vehicle `472.0` is driving behind in the right lane. Position: (380.09, 10.05), Speed: (-31.24, 0.04) m/s, Acceleration: (-0.18, 0.08) m/s^2, quantified perceived risk: 16557.04.

-Vehicle `473.0` is driving behind in the left lane. Position: (394.09, 14.41), Speed: (-39.17, 0.10) m/s, Acceleration: (-0.26, -0.00) m/s^2, quantified perceived risk: 20365.78.
Risk Quantification Structure: 
According to the structure of the risk field formulation, if the quantified perceived risk from a surrounding vehicle is high, there are several potential reasons. Keep the followings in mind when the QPR is elevated:
- The distance between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicle is short. Vehicles might be too close to each other.
- The speed of either the ego vehicle or the surrounding vehicle is high, which usually happens when one vehicle is overtaking the other.
- The heading angle of the ego vehicle or the surrounding vehicle is towards the other, which usually happens during lane changes or cutting in.


Vehicles 468 exhibit minimal risk levels, requiring no immediate intervention.
Vehicles 472, 473 exhibit risk above typical levels. Maintain awareness of these vehicles during maneuvers, always ensuring a safe time headway.
Vehicles 471 exhibit exceptional risk. Exercise rigorous caution with these vehicles, and avoid actions involving them until the risk is sufficiently mitigated.
